After completing the basic courses, my electives were around applying core
concepts to more complex problems, such as:

  - Building a web application to search for low-priced textbooks by
    integrating information from multiple external web services
  - Designing and prototyping a
    [wearable interface for mobile phones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzylG_4KfsA) using an Android phone and Bluetooth-linked
    sensors
