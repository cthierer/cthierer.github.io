I have held a few roles at Bethesda.net, including as a **web developer**, a
platform **reliability engineer**, and a development **team lead**. During that
time, I have:

* Designed and implemented a management tool for the platform, using **gRPC**
  and **Go** for the service layer, and **Node.js**/**Javascript** for the
  browser-based UI.

* Built an ephemeral load testing tool using **Locust**, **AWS ECS**, and
  **serverless.io** that allows developers to schedule load tests on an integrated
  environment via a Slack interface.

* Developed reusable web components using **React** and **Javascript** to support
  multiple client-facing single-page applications.
